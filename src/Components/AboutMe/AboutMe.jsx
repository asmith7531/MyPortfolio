    Just trying to make a side hustle a full-time gig. My long term goal is to
    become a professional web developer. The get there My plan is to get back
    into college so I can study computer science more. I was a cell biology
    major at Montana State but unfortunately had to take time off to find
    something I am passionate about. I got lucky and heard about the bootcamp at
    Rutgers. Now here I am.
    <Header size="huge">"Why do you code?"</Header> I am addicted to the instant
    gratification of getting things right and seeing the result. I love creating
    things and I am not very good at drawing so coding and web design helps me
    scratch that itch.
